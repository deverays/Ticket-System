Hello, I'm Eray, I'm here to present you a nice ticket system. If we come to the features of the ticket system, there are about 5 buttons, let me tell you in order, someone gives the profile details of the user, someone shows the active authorities, someone sends the transcript, someone opens the voice support, and someone closes the ticket, also shows the language of the user in the ticket system. I'm giving a ticket opened or the user says user language: English under embed.
